ZoMi Client Library
===================

This library is used to be a bridge between ZoneMinder and the ZoMi Machine Learning API.

The client is responsible for supplying images to the API and receiving the results. The results will the be filtered
 and notifications will be sent if configured. No machine learning is done in the client, thus it is very lightweight.
 
 THIS SOFTWARE IS IN ALPHA STAGE AND HEAVILY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THINGS WILL CHANGE.
