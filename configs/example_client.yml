  #  NOTIFICATIONS ARE WIP
  ########################
  mqtt:
    # - Use a MQTT client to publish messages to a broker
    enabled: no

    # - Allow you to set a custom MQTT topic name, formats for topics are: name/sub-name/sub-sub-name
    # - notice no leading or trailing '/'
    # - Default topic: zomi
    # - Be aware that the image and results are published under hard coded sub topics,
    # - this only apples to the root topic

    root_topic: zomi


    # - Send image to "<root_topic>/mid/<monitor ID>/image/<format>" where topic is the mqtt topic and format is either bytes or base64
    # - Home Assistant can ingest images from MQTT
    image:
      enabled: no
      # - Format of image to send, options are: bytes, base64
      # - base64 is more efficient HASS can use both formats for MQTT Camera
      format: base64
      retain: yes # Retain the image message


    # - If using TLS remember about host verification (tls_secure: no = no host verification but still encrypted)
    broker: ${MQTT_BROKER}

    # - Only use this if not using standard tcp ports, it defaults to 1883 if no TLS and 8883 if TLS, this setting will override
    #port:  1234

    # - MQTT Credentials if enabled in broker
    user: ${MQTT_USERNAME}
    pass: ${MQTT_PASSWORD}

    # - MQTT over TLS
    # - Location to MQTT broker CA certificate. Uncomment this line will enable MQTT over TLS.
    # - Also used to set mTLS CA
#    tls_ca: /path_to/mqtt_certs/ca.crt

    # - secure TLS - Enable peer verifier/verify hostname in COMMON NAME (CN:  field)
    # - if using ip address in CN field or self-signed certs then this needs to be 'no'
    # - [Default: yes]
    tls_secure: yes


    # - Here is a good guide on setting up a CA and signing server/client certificates for MQTT, even if you're using mqtt over your LAN only,
    # - it is always good to enable encryption and learn about it -> http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/creating-and-using-client-certificates-with-mqtt-and-mosquitto/
    # - I DO NOT RECOMMEND using Home Assistant MQTT broker add-on as it's a nightmare to get TLS working. (I am still unable to get the MQTT integration to connect to my broker using TLS)
    # - I run an MQTT mosquitto broker on my ZM host and hass connects to that over unencrypted connection.
    # - To enable 2-ways TLS, add client certificate and private key, Meaning you had a CA sign your broker's server key/cert
    # - and also had the CA sign the client key/cert that you are using here
    # - Location to client certificate and private key
#    tls_cert :  /path_to/mqtt_certs/client-zm.crt
#    tls_key :  /path_to/mqtt_certs/client-zm.key

        # - When push messages are sent, your ES sends a message to my cloud function
        # - that sends the message to Google's FCM servers. This is the key that authorizes
        # - your ES to send messages to my cloud function. By default, it will contain a key
        # - that authorizes with my server. If you switch to your own server, change this value
        # - You will also need to switch the server URL to your own server, use fcm:v1:url for that
        key:
        url:
      # - Location of tokens.txt that the websocket server tracks from zmNinja
      token_file: '${DATA_DIR}/push/tokens.txt'
      # - If yes, will replace notifications with the latest one
      replace_messages: no
      # - Date format to use when sending notification over push (FCM)
      # - For example, a 24 hr format would be
      #date_format: %H:%M, %d-%b
      date_fmt: "%I:%M %p, %d-%b"

      # - Set priority for android push.
      # - You can set it to high or normal.
      # - There is weird foo going on here. If you set it to high,
      # - and don't interact with push, users report after a while they
      # - get delayed by Google. I haven't quite figured out what is the precise
      # - value to put here to make sure it always reaches you. Also make sure
      # - you read the zmES faq on delayed push [Default: high]
      android_priority: high

      # - Make this yes if you are having push notification issues and want me to
      # - take a look at what is going on my server side. Default is no
      # - WARNING: If you enable this, I'll get to see your push notification details
      # - including your full token and possibly your ZM user and password that you provide
      # - as part of the picture URL. I try and automatically replace it, but no guarantees if
      # - the regex fails in certain conditions. SO KEEP THIS OFF unless you've chatted with me
      # - and you know we have exchanged notes. You should turn this off once debugging is over
      log_raw_message: no

      # - If you want me to help you debug what is going wrong in FCM, it helps
      # - if you add a unique ID here so that I know what to look for

      log_message_id: I_LOVE_LAMBSHANKS

      # - it specifies how long the message will be valid before it is discarded

  # - Gotify is a self-hosted push notification server with an Android app (no iOS)
  gotify:
    # - Attempt to send a push notification to Gotify clients
    enabled: no
    # - If you are not receiving images in gotify notifications, set this to yes to set image to a publicly available URL

    test_image: no

    # - Gotify server URL
    host: ${GOTI_HOST}
    # - Gotify App token
    token: ${GOTI_TOKEN}
    # - Override the ZM Portal URL for gotify image grabbing (useful behind a reverse proxy)
    # - say ZoneMinder web portal is http:///10.0.1.25 due to being on internal network but
    # - Gotify needs https://zm.example.com/zm to grab the images from a public URL.
    portal: ${GOTI_PORTAL}
    # - REMEMBER that Gotify grabs the image from a URL it can access instead of having it sent directly to it like pushover does.

    # - Show a clickable link to view the event in a browser (only once inside the Gotify App).
    # - this is handy if the notification goes out to a device without zmNinja installed.
    # - They can just click the link and view the event in a regular browser.
    # - NOTE: Your ZM server may need to be accessible externally for this to work correctly.

    # !! WARNING: If you use this, you are POTENTIALLY sending your ZM user and password (or JWT access token) to the Gotify server/clients,
    # - if no SSL is used IT WILL BE CLEAR TEXT! So USE SSL!
